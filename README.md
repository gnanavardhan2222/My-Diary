# My-Diary
My Diary is a Spring Framework-based web app for securely managing personal diary entries with features like user authentication, CRUD operations, and session management. It uses JSP for the frontend and Hibernate with MySQL for the backend. Future updates aim to integrate Spring Security for enhanced authentication and authorization.
